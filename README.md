# Machine-Learning
This GitHub repository is dedicated to storing and managing all the ML Alogrithms that we learn and implement in our ML course in 3-4 semester at Sitare University. Throughout the semester, I will be working on various Algorithms that are used in games and puzzel solving in real life. In this course our main objective is to learn ML algorithms and analyse their behaviours and real life applications in the field of ML and Computer science. There all are self implemented code which I am putting here, So, let me know if there is any bug/ambiguity you find.

Dive into assignments reinforcing theory and projects applying practical skills. Contribute and collaborate to enhance this learning hub.

This repository is organized to showcase my work throughout the course, and it will be regularly updated with new assignments and projects.
